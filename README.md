# CodePen Nights

A Visual Studio Code theme based on the High Contrast Syntax Theme in CodePen. This theme uses CodePen brand colors to create a set of colors that have been designed to pass WCAG AAA color contrast guidelines while still being easy on the eyes.

“I don’t code late a night, but if I did I’d use this theme.”

**Enjoy!**
